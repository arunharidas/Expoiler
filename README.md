# Expoiler
A really opinionated Boilerplate for Expo (React Native) with Mobx, Navigation and Good Thoughts!!

## Folder Structure
* components : Contains the discrete components that your apps uses. Should be fairly self contatined, stateless and should only be concerned about the presentation side of things.
* screens : Like components but with state.
* stores : Contains the stores (mobx)
